**Why use The Hack Repair Guy's Plugin Archiver?**

* Maybe you have a set of plugins that you would like to install in all of your WordPress sites, but would rather not have them listed within Plugins (until you need them).
* Maybe you've run into a buggy or possibly compromised plugin, that when activated breaks or causes harm to your website. The Hack Repair Guy's Plugin Archiver plugin will allow you to simply archive the plugin, preventing accidental activation.
* Maybe you wish to test sets of plugins, pulling different sets of plugins into your plugin list as you need them; all with just a few clicks.
* Maybe you share management with another administrator who believes the "Activate" link is an invitation to "click it!"

**With The Hack Repair Guy's Plugin Archiver, you may even upload or move plugins to your own custom archive directory.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Why was this plugin created?**

In my day to day work cleaning malware from hacked websites, I sometimes run into situations where after updating WordPress, a plugin would break  the website (causing a white screen or error message).

This has left me with a predicament. In deactivating the plugin in question, the plugin itself remained activatable within the plugins list. 

Invariably, another administrator would log in a week or so later, see the plugin deactivated and "activate" it. This would often result in an emergency–and sadly, lots of finger pointing.

So The Hack Repair Guy's Plugin Archiver plugin was born.

**Question: If I deactivate or remove the plugin what will happen?**
 
Short answer: Nothing.
Long answer: Archived plugins will remain where you left them (nicely archived), until you reactivate the The Hack Repair Guys Plugin Archiver plugin.
 
**Question: Are you planning an “unarchive all” option upon deletion of plugin?**
 
Short answer: No.
Long answer: The Hack Repair Guys Plugin Archiver was built around the concept of managing different versions of plugins saved within different archival directories. If we were to include an “unarchive all” upon deletion option, the plugin would not know which duplicate to unarchive. The result–none would be unarchived. So that feature, if implemented, would not perform as expected.
