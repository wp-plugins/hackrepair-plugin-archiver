== Why was this plugin created? ==

In my day to day work cleaning malware from hacked websites, I sometimes run into situations where after updating WordPress, a plugin would break  the website (causing a white screen or error message).

This has left me with a predicament. In deactivating the plugin in question, the plugin itself remained activatable within the plugins list. 

Invariably, another administrator would log in a week or so later, see the plugin deactivated and "activate" it. This would often result in an emergencyâ€“and sadly, lots of finger pointing.

So The Hack Repair Guy's Plugin Archiver plugin was born.
