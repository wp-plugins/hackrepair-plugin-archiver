= Why use The Hack Repair Guys Plugin Archiver? =

* Maybe you've run into a buggy plugin, that when activated breaks your home page. The Hack Repair Guys Plugin Archiver plugin will allow you to simply archive the plugin, preventing accidental activation.
* Maybe you wish to test sets of plugins, pulling different sets of plugins into your plugin list as you need them; all with just a few clicks.
* Maybe you share management with another administrator who believes the "Activate" link is an invitation to "click it!"

= With The Hack Repair Guys Plugin Archiver, you may upload or move plugins to your own custom archive directory. It's just that easy! =


== Why did you birth this plugin? ==

In my day to day work cleaning malware from hacked websites, I sometimes run into situations where after updating WordPress, a plugin would break  the website (causing a white screen or error message).

This has left me with a predicament. In deactivating the plugin in question, the plugin itself remained activatable within the plugins list. 

Invariably, another administrator would log in a week or so later, see the plugin deactivated and "activate" it. This would often result in an emergencyâ€“and sadly, lots of finger pointing.

So The Hack Repair Guys Plugin Archiver plugin was born.
