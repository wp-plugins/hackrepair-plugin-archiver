<p>Quickly deactivate and archive a plugin for later review. Archiving a plugin both deactivates and removes the plugin from your visible Plugins list.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you create this plugin?</strong></p>
<p>In my day to day work  cleaning malware from hacked websites, I sometimes run into situations where after updating WordPress or plugins, that a plugin will break  the website (causing a white screen or error message).</p>
<p>This left me with a predicament. In deactivating the plugin, the plugin remained in the main list. Invariably, another administrator would log in a week later and in seeing the plugin deactivated, “activate it,” resulting in an emergency, and sadly lots of finger pointing.</p>
<p>So my thought in developing <strong>The Hack Repair Guys Plugin Archiver</strong> was to create a plugin that would physically move the problem plugin out of the main Plugins directory and off to an archive directory.</p>
